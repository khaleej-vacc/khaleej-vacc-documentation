# Welcome To The Khaleej vACC's Standard Operating Procedures.

Welcome to the Khaleej vACC Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) page. This section serves as the official reference for all Air Traffic Controllers operating within the Kuwait (OKAC FIR) and Bahrain (OBBB FIR) airspaces on the VATSIM network.

Our SOPs ensure standardized and efficient ATC operations, maintaining alignment with real-world procedures while adapting to the needs of the online environment. Controllers are expected to be familiar with and adhere to these procedures to ensure a seamless experience for pilots and neighboring FIRs.

### Key Topics Covered: *(Work in Progress)*
âœˆ Sectorization & ATC Responsibilities

Defined enroute, approach, and aerodrome control sectors for OKAC FIR (Kuwait) and OBBB FIR (Bahrain)
Handoff procedures between sectors and adjacent FIRs
Coordination protocols for crossing traffic and airspace transitions


ðŸ“¡ Airspace Structure & Classifications

Controlled and uncontrolled airspace boundaries
Transition altitude and level requirements
Restricted and prohibited areas within the FIRs


ðŸ›¬ Arrival & Departure Management

Preferred STARs and SIDs for major airports, including OKKK (Kuwait) and OBBI (Bahrain)
Runway usage preferences based on prevailing conditions
Holdings, sequencing, and metering procedures


ðŸ›« Ground & Tower Operations

Taxiway routing and intersection departures
Pushback and startup coordination procedures
VFR circuit and pattern entry instructions


âš  Separation Standards & Special Procedures

IFR and VFR separation criteria in different airspace classes
Radar and procedural separation techniques
Emergency and contingency procedures, including weather diversions and lost communication protocols


::::info Note:
Our SOPs are regularly updated to reflect changes in real-world operations and ensure the highest standards of virtual ATC service. Controllers should review these documents frequently and ensure compliance during their sessions.
