The section outlines the Standard Operating Procedures for Delivery Operations at Bahrain International Airport (OBBI)

## 2.1 General Provisions

Bahrain Clearance Delivery **(OBBI_DEL)** or 'GMP' is responsible for validating flight plans and issuing IFR/VFR clearances to departing aircraft. This includes thoroughly reviewing the filed route, assigned altitude, and departure procedure to ensure accuracy. If any discrepancies, errors, or invalid information are detected, the controller must correct them before issuing the final clearance.

In addition to route validation, the Delivery Controller plays a key role in managing taxiway operations. To reduce delays and congestion during periods of high departure activity, proactive measures such as holding aircraft at the gate may be implemented to conserve fuel and optimize the flow of outbound traffic on the taxiways.

## 2.2 Departure Clearance
### 2.2.1 General
Delivery is responsible for issuing clearance for departing aircraft. Pilots may be expected to report the following information on first contact:
- Callsign
- Aircraft Type
- Parking Stand
- Destination
- Requested Flight Level

### 2.2.2 Information contained in a departure clearance
An IFR clearance shall be in the following format:
- Callsign
- Airway and a waypoint
- Heading after departure
- Initially cleared altitude
- Assigned SSR code

### 2.2.3 Phraseology

::::info Note
A Gulf Air flight to Dubai International Airport will be used as an example for this phraseology.
::::

**Pilot:**
>"Bahrain Delivery, Good Evening, GFA512, Type B789, Stand 18, Request IFR Clearance to Dubai International as filed."

**Controller:**
>"GFA512, Bahrain Delivery, Good Evening. Cleared to Dubai, via **N697 SODAK**, after departure fly **heading 345°**, maintain altitude **4000ft**, squawk **4411**."

::::caution Remember
The heading flown after departure will be assigned following the procedures outlined in Section 4.3.3.
::::

**Pilot:**
>"Cleared to Dubai, via N697 SODAK, after departure heading 345°, maintain altitude 4000ft, squawk 4411, GFA512."

**Controller:**
>"GFA512, readback correct, information alpha, contact Bahrain Ground 121.850 for push and start."

**Pilot:**
>"Information A, Ground 121.850, GFA512."

::::caution Remember
Delivery shall obtain a full readback of the clearance. If the pilot does not report the current ATIS letter on first contact, Delivery shall pass the current ATIS letter.

### 2.3 Datalink Clearance

Clearance for aircraft may also be provided via DCL, which helps reduce controller workload and frequency congestion. For aircraft equipped with the necessary systems, this will be delivered through the onboard ACARS system. Controllers must ensure that DCL is available for use at all times.

---

### 2.4 Aircraft requiring a reroute

Aircraft requiring a reroute shall not be given PDC/DCL. Instead, a voice clearance must be used. This shall be communicated to the pilot appropriately.

---

### 2.5 Departure Procedures

Bahrain International does not have any published SIDs. Instead, Delivery will assign an initial heading to departing aircraft.

The initial climb is **3000ft** for propeller aircraft and helicopters and **4000ft** for jet aircraft.

---

### 2.6 Requested cruising level

Aircraft routes out of the aerodrome must comply with all routing and level restrictions. This is based on direction and type of flight.

| **Destination** | **Restriction** |
|:---------------:|:---------------:|
|       OM**      |    FL 250   |
|       OKKK      |    FL 260   |
|       OOSH      |     FL 230   |
|  OTHH/OTBD/OTBH |    11000 ft  |
|       OEDF      |   6000 ft   |

## 2.7 Delay mitigation
### 2.7.1 Calculated Take-Off time (CTOT)

During periods of high intensity departure activity, aircraft shall be assigned a Calculated Take-Off Time (CTOT), either automatically or manually. The CTOT is always a minimum of 30 minutes from the present time.
Using CTOT, Delivery shall plan the departure sequence that maximises runway utilisation and results in the least average departure delay while considering direction of flight, wake turbulence category of aircraft and any other relevant consideration.

### 2.7.2 Target off-block time (TOBT)

The target off-block time is the time the aircraft is expected to push back in order to meet the CTOT.
Usually around 20 minutes prior to CTOT is a good estimate but depending on the location of the
aircraft stand in relation to the runway, it might be shorter or longer. Aircraft reporting ready before
their TOBT should be instructed to hold position and they should be told the sequence to expect.

**Example:**
>"FDB53, Hold position. Number 3 for startup, expect pushback at time 14:20z."
