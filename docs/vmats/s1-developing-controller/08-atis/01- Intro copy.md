The **Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS)** provides regular information to aircraft arriving at and departing from an airport, operating continuously for 24 hours or a specified duration. The ATIS is updated on an hourly or 30-minute basis to ensure the information remains current.

**ATIS broadcasts normally contain the following information:**
- 	ATIS designator (A, B, C...), changes with ATIS updates
-   METAR
-   Active runways for departures and arrivals
-   NOTAM
-   Requests, such as "in the initial contact, report aircraft type and stand number"
