**METAR**, which stands for Meteorological Terminal Air Report, is a standard report that provides meteorological information specific to an aerodrome. It can also be referred to simply as a routine aerodrome meteorological report. 

##  8.2.1 What is Included in a METAR
The METAR report follows a prescribed format and includes various elements, typically presented in a specific order as listed below:
- **Location (ICAO for the Airport)**
- **Date and Time of the METAR report**
- **Surface winds**
- **Visibility**
- **Weather**
- **Clouds**

***Examples of compromising symbols***

|   **+SN**  |      Heavy Snow.      |
|:----------:|:---------------------:|
| **SHRASN** | Shower Rain and Snow. |

- **Clouds**
Cloud amount is reported by specific symbols followed by the height of the cloud in hundreds of feet. 

***These symbols are:***

- **SKC (Sky Clear)** = 0/8
- **FEW (Few)** = 1-2/8
- **SCT (Scattered)** = 3-4/8
- **BKN (Broken)** = 5-7/8
- **OVC (Overcasted)** = 8/8

***Examples of a full cloud report***

FEW015 = few clouds at 1500ft, SCT030 = Scattered cloud at 3000ft

***Other symbols***

|        **CB or TCU**        |                         Significant convective cloud                         |
|:---------------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| **VV+ vertical visibility** | When the sky is obscured, Vertical Visibility can be shown by VV[Visibility] |
|           **NSC**           |                             No Significant Cloud                             |

### 8.2.1.6 **CAVOK**

When certain conditions occur simultaneously, the term CAVOK (cloud and visibility OK) is used to replace the Visibility, Cloud, and Weather groups in a METAR report.

**These conditions are as follows:**
 - Visibility is 10 kilometers or more.
 - There are no **Cumulonimbus (CB)** or **Towering Cumulus (TCU)** clouds present.
 - There are no clouds below **5000 feet** above ground level or the Minimum Sector Altitude (MSA), whichever is higher.
 - There is no significant weather affecting the aerodrome or its vicinity.

 When these conditions are met, the CAVOK indicator signifies that visibility, cloud cover, and weather conditions are favorable for flight operations.

### 8.2.1.7 **Temperature and Dewpoint**

The air temperature and dewpoint in a METAR report are provided in whole degrees **Celsius**. For instance, a notation such as 25/05 indicates that the air temperature is 25°C and the dewpoint is 5°C. In some cases, the letter **"M"** may precede the temperature or dewpoint value, indicating a negative or minus value. 

For example, M05 would represent a temperature or dewpoint of -5°C. This notation is used to indicate temperatures below freezing or in the negative range.

### 8.2.1.8 **Altimeter Pressure**

Aircraft pressure altimeters are instruments that display the aircraft's elevation relative to a specific reference point. The choice of reference point depends on the barometric pressure set on the altimeter sub-scale. The standard unit of measurement for barometric pressure is the **hectopascal (hPa)**.

**There are three sub-scales on the altimeter:**
- **QNH:** This is the pressure set on the altimeter sub-scale to indicate the aircraft's height above sea level.

- **QFE:** This is the pressure set on the altimeter sub-scale to indicate the aircraft's height above a designated reference elevation.

- **Standard Pressure:** This is the standard pressure of 1013.2 hPa, which is used by aircraft operating above the transition level. It is used to determine pressure altitude (also known as Flight Level) and provides a common reference for vertical measurements.

These altimeter sub-scales enable pilots to accurately determine their aircraft's altitude relative to the chosen reference point.

::::info For your information!
If the QNH is less than 1000, controllers need to mention the unit, **hectopascal (hPa)**.

### 8.2.1.9 **Trend**

Trend forecasts are indicated by **BECMG** (Becoming) or **TEMPO** (temporary) which may be followed by a time group (hours and minutes UTC/Zulu) preceded by one of the letters indicated **FM** (from), **TL** (until), **AT** (at). For example, **BECMG FM1030 TL1130.**

**NOSIG** replaces the trend group when **no significant changes** are forecast to occur during the 2-hour forecast period.
