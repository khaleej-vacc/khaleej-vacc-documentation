title: 6.4. Initial Climbs 
---
The initial climb refers to the altitude or flight level assigned to the pilot during the flight clearance for ascending after takeoff. 

While certain airports explicitly display the initial climb information on the **SID (Standard Instrument Departure)** charts, others may not include it. 

In the case of **King Abdulaziz International Airport (OEJN)**, the initial climb is indicated as 6000ft in the highlighted yellow box below.

To know an initial climb of a specific airport, refer to the Quick Reference Document or the respective aerodrome’s SOP. If there is no initial climb set for the aerodrome, coordinate with the higher controller.
