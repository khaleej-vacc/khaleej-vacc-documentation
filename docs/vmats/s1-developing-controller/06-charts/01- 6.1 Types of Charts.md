title: 6.1. Types of Charts 
---
Charts in aviation are graphical representations or maps that provide pilots with essential information for navigation and flight operations.

They play a crucial role in aviation as they provide essential information for pilots to navigate and maintain situational awareness both on the ground and in the air. On the ground, charts help pilots understand airport procedures, taxi routes, and other pertinent details necessary for safe ground operations. Enroute, charts enable pilots to accurately determine their position, plan their flight path, and adhere to altitude and speed restrictions.

IFR Charts can be classified into different types which are the following:
- **[SIDs] Standard Instrument Departures** | Departure route after takeoff to ensure aircraft separation.
- **[STARs] Standard Terminal Arrival Routes** | Arrival route to guide aircraft from enroute to approach phase.
- **[APP] Approach Charts** | Approach charts with instructions for landing and runway alignment.
- **[TAXI] Aerodrome Charts** | Charts with general information and procedures about the airport, as well as the aerodrome map and stands.
- **[REF] Reference Charts** | Contains important reference charts, procedures and Radar Minimum Altitudes (RMAs)
