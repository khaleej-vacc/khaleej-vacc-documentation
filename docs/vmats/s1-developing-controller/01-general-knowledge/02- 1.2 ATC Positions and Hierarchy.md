title: 1.2. ATC Positions and Hierarchy
---
On VATSIM, controllers have the option to assume specific positions that mirror real-world procedures.
These positions include:
- Delivery (DEL)
- Ground (GND)
- Tower (TWR)
- Approach (APP)
- Control (CTR)

As per the VATSIM Global Controller Adminstration Policy [GCAP], ATC shall provide a **"top-down"** service and
whenever traffic load permits cover for any missing control positions beneath them; this applies
to all control positions from CTR down.
