title: 1.4. ATC Controller Practical Test (CPT) and Solo Validation (SV)
slug: atccpt
---
A **Controller Practical Test (CPT)** serves as the conclusive assessment that a trainee must
successfully complete to obtain their rating. This evaluation takes place online, allowing the
controller to demonstrate their skills on the network. CPTs are conducted solely **for Tower (TWR)**,
**Approach/Departure (APP/DEP), and Control (CTR) positions**.

Prior to the CPT, controllers are granted a solo validation, which permits them to assume a
position higher than their approved position, as specified in the guidelines outlined in the GCAP
(Global Controller Adminstration Policy). This solo validation offers an opportunity for trainees to gain practical
experience on the network before undertaking the CPT.

::::info Do note.
Solo validation will not be assigned to OBS controllers because they do not need to hold and pass
a CPT to gain the S1 rating for DEL/GND positions.
